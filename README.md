> Used to treat water, now trying to treat code

I have been on a path of transforming myself from a water/civil engineer into web3 builder oriented, with focus on security. I'm currently working with [MAMA AI](https://www.themama.ai/) under the company github profile [0xharold](https://github.com/0xharold). On my path, I have been working on:
- [NFT Playground](https://mama-nft-playground.on.fleek.co/) which is heavily based on Patrick Alpha's [Full Stack Solidity, Smart Contract & Blockchain Course](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/full-blockchain-solidity-course-js) with some amendments. The goal here was to get familiar with web3 BE/FE;
- I have solved tasks of Damn Vulnerable DeFi (few of them by using Echidna to get familiar with it, see for instance [rewarder](https://github.com/crytic/damn-vulnerable-defi-echidna/commit/a9761b3fa60a044a3c5e37f3d1d6024cd8667677) and [selfie](https://github.com/crytic/damn-vulnerable-defi-echidna/commit/c261324008ddf36575816f12e7ffd5a4cf0fee8f)) and [EVM through CTFs](https://www.evmthroughctfs.com/) to understand EVM' bytecode better using my [DEV account](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0xdb52ab45552a079cd316a874131b91675849a7bf) (repo not public yet).
- I have also studied some code4rena reports and hacks/exploits reproduction by [DeFiHackLabs](https://github.com/SunWeb3Sec/DeFiHackLabs/blob/main/README.md).
- Attended [DeFi Security 101](https://defisecuritysummit.org/defi-101-2023/) and [DeFi Security Summit](https://defisecuritysummit.org/conference-2023/).
- I have developed an AI tool for Smart Contract Vulnerability Detection (currently on hold) and another for generating Fuzzing Boilerplate leveraging LLMs for MAMA AI. Hopefully, I will be able make them public someday.
- In addition to web3-related work, I have also contributed to several projects related to LLMs in MAMA's, where I practiced backend skills and promp engineering.
- Ocassionally, I fuzz things:
